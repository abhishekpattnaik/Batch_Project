# Batch Project

Design and code a simple MVC module using the Django framework to do below.
* Create a table “batch” with which holds the batch code and the user who generated it.
* Create another table to store codes
* Generate X number of unique random 10 digits alphanumeric code.
* Consider you have to generate at least a min of 50k to a max of 5Lakhs codes per batch.
* Store the codes in the database (Assume that the database already has millions of codes).
* Create a UI for the admin to generate the codes. Use the default Django Auth layer.
* Show the history of codes generated by that admin.
* Token-based authentication in the frontend is to be implemented.
* Frontend framework is of your choice.
* Create a search page where the code can be searched.
* Handle all exceptions and all response codes sent.
* Cover the API’s and other processes with unit tests.
